# DefiLlama Telegram Bot
A bot that you can use to interact with DefiLlama from Telegram. To find it on Telegram, literally search for DefiLlamaBot.

## What can you do with this bot?
You can do some nice things, such as:
- search for a protocol listed in DefiLlama
- compare two protocols, watching the MCAP/TVL ratio
- see the price that a protocol could have had when its TVL was at ATH, if MCAP was equal to TVL
- get a chart of the first N protocols for TVL
- get a chart of the first N performers or losers, of the last day or week
- get a chart with the protocols with highest potential, evaluating MCAP, FDV and TVL

## Acknowledgments
I would like to say thank you to DefiLlama team (free APIs are nice eheh) and to grammY's (Telegram Bot Framework) community which helped me in their Telegram group, saving me a lot of time for real.
